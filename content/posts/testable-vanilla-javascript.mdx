import RunnableExample from '../../src/components/runnable-example.js';

Every software developer has been in this place: they get asked to add a one-off feature that seems harmless, it balloons into a series of interrelated features, and, seeing it after numerous evolutions, wishes they could have written it differently. "If only I had been told _why_ this feature was wanted, I would have used a framework." "If I would have known how important this feature was for my client I would have made it more testable." This is the struggle of iterating, of allowing an organic process to create an end product instead of a 100% thought-through design that waterfalls into a desired goal.

When a small feature is being developed, one of the first things to get ignored are **tests**. Developers from different backgrounds may have occasion to write JavaScript, but wish to use the same testable structures they are familiar with. While JavaScript has its own conventions regarding code style, there are few best practices for using Dependency Injection (DI) or Inversion of Control (IOC) containers outside of a front end framework. However, due to JavaScript's flexible nature, most DI or IOC patterns from other languages can be adapted to JS. If not needing a complex and flexible pattern, vanilla JS can utilize simple patterns to make code testable. A notoriously hard thing to test are global values. Code manipulating the DOM or dealing with external libraries loaded using script tags often introduce global values. If you are maintaining legacy code or retrofitting code so it will last longer, you probably want it to be testable. The good news is that JavaScript code can easily be written or refactored so it is testable without requiring an advance framework. [CodePen examples](https://codepen.io/collection/XQqzdP/) for all of the structures described can be found below. For the purposes of simplicity, all examples use the same dependency:

```javascript
/**
 * Logger dependency
 */
function Logger(namespace) {
  this.setNamespace(namespace);
}
Logger.prototype.setNamespace = function setNamespace(namespace) {
  this.namespace = namespace;
};
Logger.prototype.log = function log(message) {
  if (this.namespace) {
    console.log(this.namespace + ': ' + message);
    return;
  }
  console.log(message);
};
function ExampleLogger(namespace, id) {
  this.lines = [];
  this.threshold = 100;
  if (namespace) {
    this.setNamespace(namespace);
  }
  if (id) {
    this.setId(id);
  }
}
ExampleLogger.prototype = Object.create(Logger.prototype);
ExampleLogger.prototype.constructor = Logger;
ExampleLogger.prototype.setId = function setId(id) {
  this.id = id;
};
ExampleLogger.prototype.setNamespace = function setNamespace(namespace) {
  this.namespace = namespace;
};
ExampleLogger.prototype.log = function log(message) {
  var formattedMessage = message;
  if (this.namespace) {
    formattedMessage = this.namespace + ': ' + message;
  }
  console.log(formattedMessage);
  this.lines.unshift(formattedMessage);
  // Doesn't currently protect against message containing \\n
  if (this.lines.length > this.threshold) {
    this.lines.pop();
  }
  var element = document.querySelector('#' + this.id);
  if (!element) {
    throw new Error('ExampleLogger cannot find element with id "' + this.id + '"');
  }
  element.innerText = this.lines.join('\n');
};
```

## Closure

Closure is a foundational JavaScript concept that gives one function access to the scope of another function. Having a function that returns a function gives you the ability to explicitly design parameters to be passed in at application bootstrapping separate from function invocation. Simply put, you can pass in the dependencies once and call the function however you want later. This keeps you from larger refactors which require creating prototypes or restructuring dependencies. If the code base is already using functional programming concepts, this also maintains a common style. This is probably the simplest way to add testability to legacy JavaScript code.

<RunnableExample clickFn={'doClosureStuff()'} exampleId={'closureLog'} code={`
function doClosureStuffInjector(logger) {
  return function doClosureStuff() {
    logger.log('Function injected via closure!');
  };
}
// App Bootstrapping
var doClosureStuff = doClosureStuffInjector(new ExampleLogger('closureInjector', 'closureLog'));
`.trim()}></RunnableExample>

## Setter-Prototype

Prototypes are central to the way JavaScript handles object instances. While most dependency injection focuses on adding arguments to a class constructor, usually even taking responsibility for instantiating the classes given to the IOC container, setter-prototype injection utilizes a method on an object instance to set the dependency after being instantiated. This allows for constructor arguments to be set separately from dependencies, offering a clear view of what is injecting dependencies vs. what is passing dynamic values.

## AngularJS Injectors

The AngularJS injection system is one of the simplest ways for a prototype or function to define what dependencies it needs. This abstraction can then be utilized automatically by an external injector. Since JavaScript functions are also objects, they can have properties defined on them. If you create a property that is an array of dependency names as strings corresponding with the constructor arguments used, you now have an abstraction of the string name defining the dependency. An external bootstrapper or injector can read this array and pass in the proper arguments as needed when the constructor is called.

## Symfony Container Builders

Symfony is a popular Object-Oriented framework for writing applications in PHP. Many front-end developers were introduced to back-end development through PHP, and many PHP frameworks are based on Symfony and its respective IOC containers. This example does not create an application context which stores the containers. It does however allow for dependencies to be handled by both constructor arguments and setter methods. This is particularly handy when you have dependencies coming from various third-party vendors that all wrote their libraries in different ways.

## Java-like Beans

Using beans is a common practice in Java programming. Developers with a Spring background might prefer this type of central configuration of dependencies. Many developers prefer configuration to be in static files like JSON or XML, and this format resembling Beans gets very close to that. If a bundler is being used, the proto property of each dependency could be replaced with a string of the path to the file, in which case the configuration could be truly static. This example did not take advantage of a bundler in order to show how this pattern could be used in legacy code.

## Conclusion

There are many ways to make vanilla JavaScript code more testable. While JS can be written using both functional and Object-Oriented paradigms, code relying on global values often introduces a lack of testability into an otherwise maintainable code base. Using any one of these methods to decouple dependencies allows for a greater ability to test standard JS scripts. And when it comes time to swap out a dependency, you should already be set up for the pivot. (Observant readers will notice me doing this in my examples, showing off the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">Liskov substitution principle</a> in action.) Hopefully something here will show itself useful to youÂ :)
