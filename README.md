## Blog

Blog post is at `/content/posts/testable-vanilla-javascript.mdx`. It uses a custom runnable example component which allows for code samples to be run and output to a log. The ability for the code samples to be sandboxed in iframes with automatic resizing was a technical hurdle I haven't seen anywhere else. If cleaned up this could be a useful Gatsby component for other people.
